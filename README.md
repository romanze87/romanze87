- ðŸ‘‹ Hi i'm Zac, I have always loved computers and programming. 
I have tried multiple times to learn C++ on my own. 
I have no reason to learn it, but I just enjoy it for some reason.
On 6/7/21 I finally finished my first program called TicTacBoom.
I'm sure the code is really horrible, but i'm proud to complete it.
I think I want to continue learning and become a freelance programmer.
